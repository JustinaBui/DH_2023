Objective: DataHouse is working on a new health information system (HIS) for a local hospital. The company wants to hire new members for this upcoming project. Using the compatibility predictor, we can select the best applicants for the position. 

Input: For the task, I used characters from one of my favorite television shows, "Grey's Anatomy." The scenario shows the company's need to hire new employees for their upcoming HIS project. On the team, we have both the former and current chief of surgery to use their attribute scores in the applicant scorecard. This will provide a fair rating system to evaluate the applicant's capability for the role. Altogether, the score formula was based on comparing the team's average score of 23.5 to the applicant's total score on the criteria.

Ouput: According to the results, Meredith Grey would be the best applicant to join the team. If we plan to hire more than one, then Christina Yang would be another great applicant to consider in the team's expansion.Â 

For example, the first applicant was Meredith Grey.
Score: 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 19
Formula: 19/23.5 = 0.8085106382978723 > 0.81
